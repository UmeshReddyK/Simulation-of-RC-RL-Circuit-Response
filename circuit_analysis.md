# # RC and RL Circuit Analysis

## RC Circuit

- **Charging**: The voltage across the capacitor exponentially approaches the input voltage. The time constant determines the rate of charging.
- **Discharging**: The voltage across the capacitor exponentially decays to zero. The time constant determines the rate of discharging.
- **Time Constant**: RC = Resistance * Capacitance.

## RL Circuit

- **Current Growth**: The current in the circuit exponentially increases from zero to its steady-state value. The time constant determines the rate of growth.
- **Current Decay**: The current in the circuit exponentially decays from its steady-state value to zero. The time constant determines the rate of decay.
- **Time Constant**: RL = Resistance * Inductance.

## Comparison

- Both RC and RL circuits exhibit exponential behavior due to the presence of a capacitor or inductor, respectively.
- The time constant in both cases determines how quickly the circuit reaches its steady-state condition.
- The RC circuit is primarily used for filtering and timing applications, while the RL circuit is commonly used in power supplies and motor control.
